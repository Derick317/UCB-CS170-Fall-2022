# UCB-CS170-Fall-2022
My solution to the homework of [CS 170 (UC Berkeley)](https://cs170.org/) and other resources about this course.
- `code` contains a backup of the released code of algorithms taught in the course;
- `homework` contains my solution to the homework, including writing problems and coding problems.

If you find typos or grammar errors, please point them out. If you have different algorithms for some problems in the homework (unnecessarily more fast or clever), feel free to contact me!
