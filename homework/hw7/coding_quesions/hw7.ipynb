A big application of this problem is in spell checking. A spell checker can correct a word if it is not in a dictionary, but its edit distance to some word in the dictionary is small, which means that the user probably intended to use the word from the dictionary and misspelled it. As a refresher, you can read about what edit distance means and about the algorithm to compute it in the textbook: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf ."

In this variation of the problem, which is called \"Knapsack without repetition\", you cannot repeat items, so if you already packed the item number $i$ into the knapsack, you cannot pack it again (in contrast to \"Knapsack with repetition\", in which you can repeat each item any number of times)."
